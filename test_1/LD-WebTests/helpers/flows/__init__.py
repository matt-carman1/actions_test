Flows are combinations of mutations that are used to perform a more complex action. For example, duplicating a Live
Report requires interaction with a Live Report's dropdown menu, *and* the metapicker:

  1. Open the LR to copy, using the metapicker
  2. Duplicate the LR, using the LR's dropdown menu
  3. Close the original LR again, so that only the newly duplicated LR has been opened in LiveDesign.
